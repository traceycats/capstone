          <h2>intermolecular - the social life of a molecule</h2>
          <p>intermolecular forces are the different ways separate molecules interact with each other. there are several different types of intermolecular forces:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>van der waals forces</li> 
                        <ul><li></li></ul>
                        <ul><li><b>london dispersion forces</b> are a subset of can der waals forces. they are the result of motions of electrons and are considered to be the weakest of all 
                        intermolecular forces. the bigger the molecule, the more london dispersion force it will have.</li> </ul>
                    <li>dipole dipole</li>
                        <ul><li>dipole dipole interactions come from electrical interactions among dipoles, they can be attractive or repulsive</li></ul> 
                    <li>ion-dipole</li>
                        <ul><li>ion dipole interactions are the result of electrical interactions between <i>ions</i> and partial charges on a polar molecule</li></ul>
                    <li>hydrogen bonding</li>
                        <ul><li></li></ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Kind of like how you interact differently in different social contexts, molecules act differently with each other.</p>
