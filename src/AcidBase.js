            <h2>acids & bases - more than just titrations</h2>
              <p>In chemistry, there are several definitions for acids and bases. Arrhenius, Bronsted-Lowry, and Lewis each had a different idea of what made an acid and what made a base.</p>
              <p>Here are the definitions in a simple way, pulled from my old organic chemistry notes: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Arrhenius</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>acids - dissolve in water to give hydronium (h3o+)</li>
                        <li>bases - dissolve in water to give hydroxide (oh-)</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Bronsted-Lowry</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>acid - proton donator</li>
                        <li>base - proton acceptor</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Lewis</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>acid - accepts electrons / is an electrophile</li>
                        <li>base - donates electrons / is a nucleophile</li>
                    </ul>
              </ul>
