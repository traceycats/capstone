          <h2>thermodynamics - how heat drives reactions</h2>
          <p>thermodynamics is a huge topic - here we will cover just the basics.</p>
          <p>there are three laws of thermodynamics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>first law of thermodynamics:</b> within a system, the total energy stays constant - <i>energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed</i>.</li>
                <ul><li>kinetic energy becomes potential energy, potential energy turns back into kinetic energy or to heat</li></ul>
            <li><b>second law of thermodynamics:</b> all systems will trend towards equilibrium</li>
            <li><b>third law of thermodynamics:</b> the entropy of a system approaches a constant when it's temperature approaches absolute zero</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Thermodynamics is also a big part of physics.</p>
